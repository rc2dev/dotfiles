# We could exit here in the case of `nitrogen --restore` (to bypass setting
# LightDM's wallpaper again in that case). This would work fine if we don't
# login into other DEs where the wallpaper is managed by other software.
# However, if we login into Cinnamon, for example, it will overwrite LightDM's
# wallpaper with the one set there. So, upon calling `nitrogen --restore`, it
# also makes sense to set the LightDM wallpaper.
