# Skip ads on Spotify. Exits if Spotify is not running.
#
# This code was simpler and placed directly in the spotify wrapper. However,
# the flatpak version complicates things by immediately exiting on launch,
# forcing us to periodically check if spotify is running if we want to kill the
# ad-skipper appropriately. This new complexity resulted in this separate file.
